    <h3>
      Window Scroll
    </h3>
    
    <p>
      We can listen for the window scroll event as follows:
    </p>
    
    <script src="https://gist.github.com/griffiths/83504f551fc2494385671b66d977db44.js"></script>
    
    <p>
      We can also grab the current scroll position using <code><strong>$(window).scrollTop()</strong></code>.
    </p>
    
    <h3>
      Window Resize
    </h3>
    
    <p>
      We can listen for the window resize event as follows:
    </p>
    
    <script src="https://gist.github.com/griffiths/92ba01406a86b7d86181592d63d10f4c.js"></script>
    
    <p>
      And we can use <code><strong>$(window).width()</strong></code> and <code><strong>$(window).height()</strong></code> to grab the current width and height of our viewport.
    </p>
    
    <h3>
      Mousemove
    </h3>
    
    <p>
      Fires every time the mouse moves:
    </p>
    
    <script src="https://gist.github.com/griffiths/4061f2d48a1b25edf6ab1746748b6b3d.js"></script>
    
    <h3>
      The Event Object
    </h3>
    
    <p>
      The event object contains many variables and functions that we may want to use in our program, the most common of which are as follows:
    </p>

    
    
<h4><code>pageX, pageY</code></h4><p>The mouse position at the time the event occurred, relative to the top left corner of the page display area (not the entire browser window).</p>
<h4><code>which</code></h4><p>The button or key that was pressed.</p>
<h4><code>target</code></h4><p>The DOM element that initiated the event.</p>
<h4><code>timeStamp</code></h4><p>The difference in milliseconds between the time the event occurred in the browser and January 1, 1970.</p>
<h4><code>preventDefault()</code></h4><p>Prevent the default action of the event (e.g. following a link).</p>
<h4><code>stopPropagation()</code></h4><p>Stop the event from bubbling up to other elements.</p>
